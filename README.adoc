= vim-semantic-linebreaks

An attempt to use implement semantic linebreaks as a reusable set of functions.

Inspired by http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/

Currently,
there's no standardized way to set this up on a per-markup basis.
If you want to add a variant for
LaTeX or
markdown,
edit autoload/semantic_linebreaks.vim and
declare the function in semantic_linebreaks#<markup>.
Also don't forget to set up a buffer local command that calls the appropriate function.

The next one I'm probably going to add here is markdown since I also know that well.
I'll add any edge cases I can think of here.

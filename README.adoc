= vim-semantic-linebreaks

An attempt to use implement semantic linebreaks as a reusable set of functions.

Inspired by http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/

Currently,
there's no standardized way to set this up on a per-markup basis.
If you want to add a variant for
LaTeX or
markdown,
edit autoload/semantic_linebreaks.vim and
declare the function in semantic_linebreaks#<markup>.
Also don't forget to set up a buffer local command that calls the appropriate function.

Please send a pull request if you do!
I'd love to use this for
more markup formats that allow such.

In case you're wondering,
all of this was actually typed with semantic linebreaks from the plugin.
Check out the source of this README!

The next one I'm probably going to add here is markdown since I also know that well.
I'll add any edge cases I can think of here.
